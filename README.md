# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Current score: 0.79426

This is a classic dataset on Kaggle and the goal is to predict passenger survival on the RMS Titanic, which was one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  This dataset contains all the names of the passengers including other information such as their gender, age, cabin class, trip fare etc.

After exploring the data, I found that the most import features were age, gender, ticket type, trip fare, passenger class and the title of the person.  There was a lot of missing data particularly the age which was a big predictor of survival, so I used the name titles to bin the passengers into certain age groups.
